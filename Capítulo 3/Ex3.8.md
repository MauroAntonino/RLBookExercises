Exercise 3.8 Suppose = 0.5 and the following sequence of rewards is received R1 = -1, R2 = 2, R3 = 6, R4 = 3, and R5 = 2, with T = 5. What are G0, G1, ..., G5? Hint: Work backwards.

 

Gt = ∑ y**k(R(t+k+1)),

G0 = R1 + ϒG1 = 1 + (1/2)*6 = 2

G1 = R2 + ϒG2 = 2 + (1/2)*8 = 6

G2 = R3 + ϒG3 = 6 + (1/2)*4 = 8

G3 = R4 + ϒG4 = 3 + (1/2)*2 = 4

G4 = R5 + ϒG5 = 2 + 0 = 2

G5 = 0
